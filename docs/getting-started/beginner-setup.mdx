description: Simple, non-technical steps to open the project and run the basic checks.
---

This guide helps you open the project on your computer and run the basic checks.
You do not need to write code.

## What You Will Do

- Install one tool (Nix) that prepares the environment.
- Open the project folder in a terminal.
- Run the standard checks.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux.
- A stable internet connection.
- Enough disk space for downloads (several GB).

If you use Windows, use WSL2 and follow the Linux steps.

## Step 1: Install Nix

Install Nix from the official installer.
If you cannot install software on this computer, ask a developer for help.

## Step 2: Open the Project Folder

If you already have the project folder, open a terminal and move into it.
For example:

```sh
cd /path/to/asset-swap
```

If you do not have the project yet, ask a developer for the correct link.

## Step 3: Enter the Development Environment

Run this command and wait until it finishes:

```sh
nix develop
```

This command downloads the tools the project needs.
The first run can take several minutes.

## Step 4: Run the Standard Checks

Run the full check suite:

```sh
just ci
```

You should see a success message.
Some end-to-end tests are skipped by default, which is expected.

## Next Steps

- For the API overview, read [LN⇄Liquid Swap (gRPC)](/swap/ln-liquid-swap).
- For a full regtest demo, read [Issue and sell an RWA (regtest)](/swap/rwa-issuance-and-sale).

## Troubleshooting

- `nix: command not found`
  - Nix is not installed. Go back to Step 1.
- `just: command not found`
  - Run `nix develop` again and retry the command.
- The checks take a long time
  - This is normal on the first run. It downloads dependencies.

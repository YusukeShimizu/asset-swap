title: Introduction
description: Minimal LN⇄Liquid swap (gRPC) and how to develop it.
---

This repository keeps all documentation content under `docs/` so it can be deployed with Mintlify.
The site configuration lives in `docs/docs.json`.

## Swap

This repository includes a minimal LN⇄Liquid swap implementation over gRPC.

- [LN⇄Liquid Swap (gRPC)](/swap/ln-liquid-swap)
- [Swap Protocol Overview](/swap/protocol-overview)
- [Issue and sell an RWA (regtest)](/swap/rwa-issuance-and-sale)

## API (Protobuf)

The swap API schema lives under `proto/` and is managed with Buf.

- Start here: [Protobuf overview](/protobuf/overview)
- Service design notes: [API design](/protobuf/api-design)
- Validation annotations: [Protovalidate](/protobuf/validation)
- Tooling and CI: [Buf and CI checks](/protobuf/buf-and-ci)

## CI checks

CI runs the same quality gates as local development.

Recommended locally (direnv):

```sh
direnv allow
just ci
```

CI (and without direnv):

```sh
nix develop -c just ci
```

If you update documentation, run the documentation checks locally before opening a PR.

## Getting Started (Beginner)

If you are new to the project, start with:

- [Beginner Setup (Local)](/getting-started/beginner-setup)
